# CODHASH Coding Guidelines

Welcome to our coding universe! We believe in clean, efficient, and accessible code. Here are our guidelines for TSX/JSX:

## 1. Code Style

We follow the [Airbnb JavaScript/React Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). It's a comprehensive guide that helps us write readable and maintainable code. Please familiarize yourself with it.

## 2. Linting

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with plugins for React and TypeScript. It helps us catch errors and enforce our style guide. Please ensure your code is lint-free before pushing.

## 4. Testing

We believe in test-driven development. We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. Please write tests for your code and ensure they pass before pushing.

## 5. Documentation

Clear, concise comments and documentation make our code understandable. We use [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for documentation. Please document your code and functions.

## 6. Code Reviews

Code reviews are mandatory for all pull requests. They help us catch issues and learn from each other. Please be respectful and constructive in your reviews.

## 8. Accessibility

We believe in building accessible software. We enforce accessibility best practices with [jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y). Please ensure your code is accessible.

## 9. Performance

We strive for efficient code. Please consider performance optimization practices, like lazy loading and code splitting.

## 10. Security

Security is paramount. Please follow security best practices, like avoiding eval() and enforcing Content Security Policy.

Happy coding!
